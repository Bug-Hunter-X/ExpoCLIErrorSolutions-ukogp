The solution to these errors usually involves careful version management and checking the project's configuration files for inconsistencies.

**1. Check Expo CLI Version:**
```bash
npx expo --version
```
Ensure the CLI version aligns with the `expo` version listed in your project's `package.json` dependencies.  If there's a mismatch, update either the CLI or the project's dependencies to match.

**2. Verify Project Dependencies:**
Examine your `package.json` to ensure all dependencies are compatible with each other and the Expo CLI version.  Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to analyze the dependency tree and identify any potential conflicts. If any are detected, consider updating them using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.

**3. Review `app.json` and `eas.json`:**
Carefully check the configuration within `app.json` for any typos or incorrect settings. If using EAS Build, meticulously review `eas.json` for any errors.  A small mistake in either file can lead to significant build problems. 

**4. Clean and Rebuild:**
Sometimes, a clean build resolves the issue. Try deleting the `node_modules` folder, then reinstalling the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`. After this, run `expo start`.

**5.  Use a Fresh Project (For Extreme Cases):**
As a last resort, create a new Expo project and gradually transfer your code. This helps to isolate the problem and rule out issues caused by project-specific configurations or files.

This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the Expo CLI version and the project's dependencies, or when there are issues with the project's configuration files (like `package.json` or `app.json`).  It can manifest in various ways, often preventing the app from starting or building correctly. For example, you might encounter messages about missing modules, incorrect paths, or dependency conflicts.

Example Scenario: Let's say your `package.json` lists `expo` version 47, but your global Expo CLI is version 46. This incompatibility can lead to cryptic errors during `expo start` or `expo build`. 

Another common scenario involves issues with the `eas.json` file (if using Expo EAS Build). Incorrect configurations here can result in build failures with ambiguous error messages.
